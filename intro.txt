Project Origin Note

This project idea was originally conceptualized by Anshuman Singh (DataBoySu) during
preparation for Smart India Hackathon 2025 under the working title
“MoSwasthya Sathi”.

The concept was later refined and re-scoped during submission to the
NES Innovation Awards under the title “MoSathi”.

The current repository exists to document the evolution of the idea and
to support the future development of a minimum viable product (MVP),
with a focus on system design, backend architecture, and infrastructure
engineering.
