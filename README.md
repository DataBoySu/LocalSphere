# LocalSphere

LocalSphere is a public information system designed to make local and region-level insights accessible to everyone.

The platform combines shared public kiosks with companion mobile and web applications to serve both users with reliable internet access and those without personal devices or connectivity.

LocalSphere provides location-aware information such as public advisories, healthcare alerts, historical patterns, and essential local context through an intuitive map-based and conversational interface.

The system is designed around a centralized backend, enabling scalable deployment, remote management, and multilingual, low-barrier access across diverse regions.
